# hypernews-portal
Online News Web Application Training Project. The main page of the site is a list of news. 
There is a search form. It is also possible for the user to add news to the site himself.

In this project, I used Django to create an online news web application.
I learned the basics of Django: how to process data over HTTP and work with templates. 
I learned how to create user request handlers, customize links, and create page templates. 
I also gained new skills with JSON files, the Python DateTime type and css basics.
